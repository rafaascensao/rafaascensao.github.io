description: My name is Pedro Ascens√£o. I am a ML/Data Engineer currently working at Cazoo. Since music is one big passion of mine, I decided to create this blog music for several reasons, but mostly because I needed a space to write my ideas about music and music tech.

First of all, I do not have any experience in composing or writing music. If you are looking for intricate reviews of your favorite albums, there is a [melon head](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt7fwAhXDy3oNFTAzF2o8Pw) that does a better job at that than me (although he gave a 6 to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy for some reason). The idea is to write weekly about an vynil album that I bought, more in terms of, what I like in the album generally, why did I buy it, and why should you listen. This gives me a reason to buy more vynils without admitting that maybe I have an addiction.

Second, once in a while, I will write about some music tech project I am working on. It can be a Chat Bot that has some overengineered architecture with the simple objective of sending Kanye quotes. Or maybe a super sofiscated music recommendation website.

Finally, this will also be a place where I will plug my Spotify playlists, so I have a reason to spend even more time curating playlists.

I hope you like reading this blog as much as I like writing it.
