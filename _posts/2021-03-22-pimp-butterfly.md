> I remember you was conflicted \
Misusing your influence \
Sometimes I did the same \
Abusing my power, full of resentment \
Resentment that turned into a deep depression \
Found myself screaming in the hotel room \
I didn’t wanna self destruct \
The evils of Lucy was all around me \
So I went running for answers \
Until I came home \
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt \
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned \
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was \
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one \
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination \
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned \
The word was respect \
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's \
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man \
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets \
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us \
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga

<div style="text-align: right"> Kendrick Lamar on Mortal Man </div>

From its provoking cover to the beautiful blend of Jazz and Hip-Hop on its music, To Pimp a Butterfly from Kendrick Lamar is an masterpiece of a vinyl. In the last music, Mortal Man, Kendrick reads the poem above to the late rapper Tupac, which beautifully describes the whole vinyl. However, this poem is not only read at the end, as it is built along the vinyl, describing the life experiences of Kendrick thourought the years.

After the song King Kunta, the first two lines of the poem are read. All songs and skits until that point are agressive and their lyrics represent the eagerness of Kendrick to try to flip the negativity associated with the Afro-American society into something powerful ("King") at all costs. 

After reading the first two verses, the instrumentals of the tracks that follow ("Institutionalized" and "These Walls") become more mellow and much more instrospective. In "These Walls", which is one of my favorites tracks of the album, Kendrick describes having sex with a woman who has children with a man in jail for killing one of Kendrick’s friends. He has mixed feelings about this situation, feeling that his "enemy" deserved it but at the same time feels bad for using his fame and power to seduce someone for this purpose. This ties perfectly with the verses read right after (3-6).

This misuse of power and influence is making Kendrick to hate himself, which leads us to the track "u". In the song, his depression and rage at himself is at an all-time peak, with Kendrick saying he is never liked himself, blaming himself for his loved ones leaving and his not worthy to have the power and influence that he has. As Kendrick Lamar reaches the peak of depression by having suicidal thoughts on "u", there is a complete switch and "Alright" starts playing. This music is probably one of the most important tracks on the album in terms of storytelling, since is in this track that Kendrick finally finds himself. He feels like that everything will work out, but more importantly, although he does not feel is worthy of all the praise and influence he has, we will work to overcome his depression and to keep his head high despite the struggles.
